		<h1 class="name">Support Driven Compensation Survey</h1>
	</div>
	<div class='info'>
		<div class="about text">
			 <p>
			 	Earlier this year the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1HRK8eFycXO84UiJvkm_Vp8loYoWOb9Q88cxqzMK6CTQ/viewform?pli=1&edit_requested=true">compensation survey</a> for the <a href="http://supportdriven.com/">Support Driven</a> Community was passed around. In the survey Support Pros from around the world answered questions regarding their experience, company size, city size and other factors that go into a salary. Through 60 responses the average salary of someone who has completed the survey is $65,874. Today I break down the survey in greater detail.

			 	The raw data I used can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-lADT-1kLHWf3gzeE_pZGIgHGeQFTKBbI_cT9haOk70/edit#gid=1539489065">here</a>

			 <h1 class="largetext center">Male v. Female Pay</h1>
			 <p>To me the question I was most interested in learning was "What gender earns more?". I think it's well documented that men earn more than women, even in a field like <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2013/02/25/male-nurses-make-more-money/">nursing</a> and I wanted to know how much that is the case in the support world. I was incredibly happy to see there wasn't an invisible gender towards men, but women actually earn more than men from our survey responders - Averaging $5,892 more than men. As a data point we had 21 female responses and 39 male responses (One individual chose not to share their gender).</p>
			 <p>The Averages:</p>
			 <ul label"Average">
			 	<li>Female	$69,591</li>
			 	<li>Male	$63,688</li>
			 </ul>
			 <p>The Median:</p>
			  <ul label"Average">
			 	<li>Female	$60,000 </li>
			 	<li>Male	$56,700 </li>
			 </ul>

			<h1 class="largetext center">Company Size</h1>
			<p>The next interesting stat I pulled was pay compared to company size. I always assumed working at a larger company meant more money and this helped affirm this assumption. Though this category does suffer from 34 of the 60 respondents being from small companies, it could be with 20+ more respondents from large companies the salary for those workers would come down. To me the biggest surprise was 5 of the 9 respondents from large companies receive equity, assuming the company is doing well that would be another major benefit in the future.</p>
			<p>The Averages:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Small	$61,339</li>
				<li>Medium	$71,369</li>
				<li>Large+	$74,856</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Median:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Small	$57,600</li>
				<li>Medium	$60,000</li>
				<li>Large+	$77,000</li>
			</ul>
			<P>* As a note I combined the Very Small & Small categories as well as Large & Big Corporate when getting these numbers.</P>

			<h1 class="largetext center">Experience</h1>
			<p>The Support Driven community confirms an assumption of mine - The more you know, the more you'll be paid. In the experience section those counted themselves as having the experience of Support as a "Way of Life" earned much more than newcomers to the field, making an average of $27,449 than the newbies. Though I do wish the experience was broken up by year instead of a name that might be disputed person to person on how much experience that means.</p>
			<p>The Averages:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>New	        $49,125</li>
				<li>Few Years	$60,967</li>
				<li>Way of Life	$76,574</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Median:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>New	        $49,250</li>
				<li>Few Years	$55,000</li>
				<li>Way of Life	$70,000</li>
			</ul>

			<h1 class="largetext center">Working Remotely Pay</h1>
			<p>Looking at another variable I was curious if working remotely had a major change in pay. Personally I'm romanticized by the idea of working from a co-working spot of my choice or at home feet away from the coffee maker or on the deck - I always wondered if that meant taking a hit in salary to have that freedom. From the data it appears that working remote gives you a higher Median pay by $4,900 (There's someone who works from an office making $180,000 that throws off the average). To me that's slightly surprising as I would have thought companies might pay a little less if you have the benefit of remote work.</p>
			<p>The Averages:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>remote	    $63,560 </li>
				<li>non remote	$67,031</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Median:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>remote	    $62,500</li>
				<li>non remote	$57,600 </li>
			</ul>

			<h1 class="largetext center">Local Cost of Living</h1>
			<p>This was one of the more surprising pieces of information for me. The cities were broken into 3 major categories: $$ (e.g. Tallinn, Warsaw, Bucharest, Santiago), $$$ (e.g. Nashville, Birmingham, Vienna, Austin, Vegas, Tel Aviv), and $$$$ (e.g. San Francisco, Hong Kong, Sydney, London, Paris, New York). There was also a $, but there was only one responder to that size. I expected there to be a large bump with each city size increase, but from the data both $$ and $$$ are nearly the same. The difference between the $$ / $$$ and $$$$ in average salary was nearly $20,000. At first this seemed unreal benefit of living in a larger city, though I quickly remembered just your salary isn't everything to take into consideration. I went to the <a href="http://money.cnn.com/calculator/pf/cost-of-living/">CNN Money Cost of Living Calculator</a> to compare the Nashville to San Francisco. A $55,000 salary in Nashville would have to translate to a salary of $101,994 in San Francisco for a similar take home salary with cost of living included. After doing that it's clear that while $$$$ might have a higher average salary those in smaller cities most likely have a higher take home salary after you take out cost of living (Now of course maybe everyone in smaller towns are driving Maserati's and living in mansions).</p>
			<p>The Averages:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>$$	 -  $60,500</li>
				<li>$$$	 -  $62,126</li>
				<li>$$$$ -	$72,595</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Median:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>$$	 -  $58,500</li>
				<li>$$$  -  $55,000</li>
				<li>$$$$ -	$76,000</li>
			</ul>

			<h1 class="largetext center">So how do you maximize your salary?</h1>
			<p>After breaking down the data I can make some suggestions on how to maximize your salary: Work remote, live in city of medium cost of living (Sorry, Silicon Valley) and stick at support to gain the necessary experience to ask for the higher salary. That might sound like common sense, but it's really cool seeing real data back that information up. Working at a large company and being a female wouldn't hurt either.
