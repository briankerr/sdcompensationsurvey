	</div>
	<div class='info'>
		<div class="about text">
			 Earlier this year the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1HRK8eFycXO84UiJvkm_Vp8loYoWOb9Q88cxqzMK6CTQ/viewform?pli=1&edit_requested=true">compenstation survey</a> for the <a href="http://supportdriven.com/">Support Driven</a> Community was passed around. In the survey Support Pros from around the world answered questions regarding their experiance, company size, city size and other factors that go into a salary. Through 61 respones the aveage salary of someone who has completed the survey is $65,874. Today I break down the survey in greater detail.

			 <h1 class="largetext center">Male v. Female Pay</h1>
			 <p>To me the question I was most interested in learning was "What sex earns more?" I was increbibly happy to see there wasn't an extreme male pay slant.</p>
			 <p>The Averages:</p>
			 <ul label"Average">
			 	<li>Female	$69,591</li>
			 	<li>Male	$63,688</li>
			 </ul>
			 <p>The Median:</p>
			  <ul label"Average">
			 	<li>Female	$60,000 </li>
			 	<li>Male	$56,700 </li>
			 </ul>

		<div class="contact text">
			<h1 class="largetext center">Company Size</h1>
			<p>The next interesting stat I pulled was pay compared to company size. I always assumed working at a larger company meant more money and this helped affirm this assumption.</p>
			<p>The Averages:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Small	$61,339</li>
				<li>Medium	$71,369</li>
				<li>Large+	$74,856</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Median:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Small	$57,600</li>
				<li>Medium	$60,000</li>
				<li>Large+	$77,000</li>
			</ul>
			<P>* As a note I combined the Very Small & Small categories as well as Large & Big Corporate when getting these numbers.</P>

			<h1 class="largetext center">Experiance</h1>
			<p>The Support Driven community seems to confirm an assumption of mine - The more you know, the more you'll be paid. In the experiance section those counted themselves as seeing Support as a way of life earned much more than new comers to the field.</p>
			<p>The Averages:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>New	        $49,125</li>
				<li>Few Years	$60,967</li>
				<li>Way of Life	$76,574</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Median:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>New	        $49,250</li>
				<li>Few Years	$55,000</li>
				<li>Way of Life	$70,000</li>
			</ul>

		<div class="contact text">
			<h1 class="largetext center">Working Remotely Pay</h1>
			<p>Looking at another variable I was curious if working remotely had a major change in pay. It doesn't seem as though working remote gives you a big pay bump nor does it hurt you.</p>
			<p>The Averages:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>remote	    $63,560 </li>
				<li>non remote	$67,031</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Median:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>remote	    $62,500</li>
				<li>non remote	$57,600 </li>
			</ul>
