		<h1 class="name">Support Driven Compensation Survey</h1>
	</div>
	<div class='info'>
		<div class="about text">
			 Earlier this year the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1HRK8eFycXO84UiJvkm_Vp8loYoWOb9Q88cxqzMK6CTQ/viewform?pli=1&edit_requested=true">compensation survey</a> for the <a href="http://supportdriven.com/">Support Driven</a> Community was passed around. In the survey Support Pros from around the world answered questions regarding their experience, company size, city size and other factors that go into a salary. Through 61 response the average salary of someone who has completed the survey is $65,874. Today I break down the survey in greater detail.

			 <h1 class="largetext center">Male v. Female Pay</h1>
			 <p>To me the question I was most interested in learning was "What sex earns more?" I was incredibly happy to see there wasn't an extreme male pay slant.</p>
			 <p>The Averages:</p>
			 <ul label"Average">
			 	<li>Female	$69,591</li>
			 	<li>Male	$63,688</li>
			 </ul>
			 <p>The Median:</p>
			  <ul label"Average">
			 	<li>Female	$60,000 </li>
			 	<li>Male	$56,700 </li>
			 </ul>

			<h1 class="largetext center">Company Size</h1>
			<p>The next interesting stat I pulled was pay compared to company size. I always assumed working at a larger company meant more money and this helped affirm this assumption.</p>
			<p>The Averages:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Small	$61,339</li>
				<li>Medium	$71,369</li>
				<li>Large+	$74,856</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Median:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Small	$57,600</li>
				<li>Medium	$60,000</li>
				<li>Large+	$77,000</li>
			</ul>
			<P>* As a note I combined the Very Small & Small categories as well as Large & Big Corporate when getting these numbers.</P>

			<h1 class="largetext center">Experiance</h1>
			<p>The Support Driven community seems to confirm an assumption of mine - The more you know, the more you'll be paid. In the experience section those counted themselves as seeing Support as a way of life earned much more than new comers to the field.</p>
			<p>The Averages:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>New	        $49,125</li>
				<li>Few Years	$60,967</li>
				<li>Way of Life	$76,574</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Median:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>New	        $49,250</li>
				<li>Few Years	$55,000</li>
				<li>Way of Life	$70,000</li>
			</ul>

			<h1 class="largetext center">Working Remotely Pay</h1>
			<p>Looking at another variable I was curious if working remotely had a major change in pay. It doesn't seem as though working remote gives you a big pay bump nor does it hurt you.</p>
			<p>The Averages:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>remote	    $63,560 </li>
				<li>non remote	$67,031</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Median:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>remote	    $62,500</li>
				<li>non remote	$57,600 </li>
			</ul>

			<h1 class="largetext center">Local Cost of Living</h1>
			<p>This was one of the more surprising pieces of information for me. The cities were broken into 3 major categories: $$ (e.g. Tallinn, Warsaw, Bucharest, Santiago), $$$ (e.g. Nashville, Birmingham, Vienna, Austin, Vegas, Tel Aviv), and $$$$ (e.g. San Francisco, Hong Kong, Sydney, London, Paris, New York). There was also a $, but there was only one responder to that size. I epected there to be a large bump with each city size increase, but from the data both $$ and $$$ are nearly the same. The difference between the $$ / $$$ and $$$$ in average salary was nearly $20,000. At first this seemed unreal benefit of living in a larger city, though I quickly remembered just your salary isn't everything to take into consideration. I went to the <a href="http://money.cnn.com/calculator/pf/cost-of-living/">CNN Money Cost of Living Calculator</a> to compare the Nashville to San Francisco. A $55,000 salary in Nashville would have to translate to a salary of $101,994 in San Francisco for a similar take home salary with cost of living included. After doing that it's clear that while $$$$ might have a higher average salary those in smallier cities most likely have a higher take home salary after you take out cost of living (Now of course maybe everyone in smaller towns are driving Maserati's and living in mansions).</p>
			<p>The Averages:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>$$	 -  $60,500</li>
				<li>$$$	 -  $62,126</li>
				<li>$$$$ -	$72,595</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Median:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>$$	 -  $58,500</li>
				<li>$$$  -  $55,000</li>
				<li>$$$$ -	$76,000</li>
			</ul>
